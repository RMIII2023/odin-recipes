    <h2>Pairing Cauliflower and Potatoes</h2>
        <p><em>Aloo-Gobi</em> is a fan favorite for many people and this is for good reason. People love potatoes generally speaking but when you pair them with cauliflower and the recipes spices you get an unbeatable dish. It's flavor goes great with naan or some rice on the side. If you're brave you can have it extra spicy.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>2 fresh green chilies, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 potatoes, peeled and cut into 2cm dice</li>
            <li>2 tomatoes, finely diced</li>
            <li>1/2 head of cauliflower, cut into florets</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon amchoor (dried mango powder) or lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>A small handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped, to garnish</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>Rotis, to serve</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan over a high heat and add the cumin seeds. As soon as they darken, add the onion and fry for about 6 minutes until soft. Add the ginger-garlic paste and chillies and fry for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Tip in the potatoes. Fry for a couple of minutes, stirring frequently to prevent the mixture from sticking to the bottom of the pan, then add the tomatoes and allow to soften. Cook for a couple of minutes, then tip in the cauliflower florets, turmeric and amchoor powder (if using) and season with salt. Mix well, reduce the heat and cook for 30 minutes, sprinkling in a couple of handfuls of water if it begins to stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>When the vegetables are completely done, remove from the heat, sprinkle with the garam masala, add lemon juice (if using instead of amchoor), season to taste and serve hot sprinkled with the coriander and rotis alongside.</li>
            
        </ol>
