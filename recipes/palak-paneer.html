    <h2>This dish will change your life for the better</h2>
   
    <p><em>Palak Paneer</em> is unlike anything you have or ever will taste. It is quite simply one of the best foods on this planet. It's the perfect mixture of spianch, spices, tomatoes, and cubed cheese that is to die for. Paired with some garlic/onion naan you just can't go wrong. If the opportunity presents itself I choose palak paneer at least <strong>110%</strong> of the time, and yes while this may be an exaggeration it goes to show how I feel about this dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>450g Spinach, washed and drained(or frozen)</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>large pinch of dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi - optional)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>
            <li>2 large tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon medium-hot red chilli powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>225g paneer, cubed</li>
            <li>salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the spinach in a heavy-based pan over a high heat with 3 tablespoons of water and wilt for 5 minutes. Leave to cool slightly then blitz in a blender along with the cooking water to form a thick puree. Set aside</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan over a high heat, add the cumin seeds and fry until they turn slightly dark, then tip in the fenugreek leaves (if using). Add the onion and fry for 7-8 minutes until soft, then stir in the ginger-garlic paste and tomatoes and cook over a low heat for 5 minutes until soft. Stir in the spice powders and a couple of tablespoons of water and continue cooking for a few minutes until the oil begins to seperate.</li>
            <li>Pour in the spinach puree, season with salt, reduce the heat and gently add the cubed paneer. Simmer for 1 minute then remove from the heat. The paneer will soften in the heat. Serve hot with roti, or as an accompainment to rice and Tarka Dal.</li>
        </ol>
